# Facial Gender Detection  

Facial Gender Detection is a machine learning project that predicts the gender of individuals based on facial images. This project leverages image processing techniques and deep learning models to classify images as either male or female with high accuracy.  

Key Features  
Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation of facial images for optimal model performance.  
Deep Learning: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features and classify gender effectively.  
High Accuracy: Achieves reliable results on both training and test datasets.  

How It Works  
1. Data Preparation: The facial images are preprocessed to enhance quality and consistency.  
2. Model Training: A CNN model is trained on a labeled dataset of male and female facial images.  
3. Prediction: The trained model predicts the gender of input facial images.  

Technologies Used  
Python  
Keras (Deep Learning Framework)  
OpenCV (Image Processing)  
Jupyter Notebook  

Future Scope  
Extend to multi-class classification, such as age detection or emotion recognition.  
Deploy the model using web frameworks for real-time applications.  
Integrate with live video streams for on-the-fly gender detection.
